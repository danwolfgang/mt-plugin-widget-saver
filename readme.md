# Widget Saver plugin for Movable Type

If you're a heavy user of Template Sets and Widget Sets, you may have discovered the same annoyance I have: Widget Sets are refreshed, just like every other template, which is a problem if it's been reorganized. And that inviting drag-n-drop Widget Set interface means it likely has been reorganized!

This plugin adds two checkboxes to the Template Refresh screen: Save the Widget Sets, and Save the Widgets. Enabled by default, they will cause the Template Refresh to ignore any existing Widget Sets or Widgets. Ta da!
